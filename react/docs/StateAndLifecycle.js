      <p>In Kiwi Js the we can not acces straing to the state of the components. We can handle it by a a special method called <strong>this.useState()</strong>.</p>
      <p>This method return an array with two elements. The first one is a shallow copy of one element of the state and se second element is a setter method.</p>
        <DisplayCode content="useStateExample"></DisplayCode>
      <p>The method receive a defaul value of the state element you want to handle witch is use only the first time the component is run.</p>
      <p>After the first run the value of that state element is changing as much as to want using the setter method.</p>
      <p>The destructuring javascript sintax is  really useful to work with.</p>
      <p>You can change the value of the shallow copy as you want and there is not restriction to do that.</p>
      <p>You must to know that the setter method has a side effect witch is re-execute the function component to re render the component.</p>

      <h2>The UseState Method</h2>
      <p>It is not needed import any special module to work with <strong>this.useState()</strong>  method.</p>
      <p>The best way to use the <strong>this.useState()</strong>  method is combining with localStorage API.</p>
      <DisplayCode full="true" content="useStateExample2"></DisplayCode>
      <p>You will find a cool example in the landing page of this website in the TodoList Project.</p>
      <p>That example is using  some other special method tha we will see in the following lesson such as <strong> this.beforeAppendChild</strong>  method, <strong> this.arrayDispatcher</strong>  method, and <strong> this.enableEvents</strong>  method.</p>
